# Good-Enough Model Spaces
We include a preliminary selection of code demonstrating GEMS in practice. More complete code (corresponding to all three datasets) is forthcoming. 


**GEMS ( Neural Network).ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing a single run (end-to-end) for GEMS with a two layer neural network on MNIST (5 nodes)

**GEMS (Convex).ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing a single run (end-to-end) for GEMS with a logistic model on MNIST (5 nodes)

**data/**: partitioned MNIST data used for the notebook tasks 

**utils/**: utility files for training models/executing GEMS
